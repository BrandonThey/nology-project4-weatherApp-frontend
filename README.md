This is a React website as a beginner project.

Description: I created a basic website that displays weather information that has been fetched from OpenWeatherMap API and stores the caches the weather in a secondary API that I made.  It is meant to be used in tandem with the nology-project4-weatherApp-backend repository: https://github.com/BrandonThey/nology-project4-weatherApp-backend.git.
This project was to practice and implement new skills in React, which was done through the use of React components and containers, useStates, and fetching from APIs.

How to install and run the project:

1. Fork both this repository and the backend repository found here: https://github.com/BrandonThey/nology-project4-weatherApp-backend.git.
2. Clone both forked repositories
3. Open up the backend repository and install all dependencies using npm install.
4. Start the backend project using npm run watch, this will start up an API that listens on port 3030 for any queries.
5. Open up the frontend repository and install all dependencies using npm install.
6.  Run the project using npm start
7. Explore around


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
